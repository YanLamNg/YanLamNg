### Hey, I'm YanLam Ng

Hello, My name is Yan Lam Ng.
I graduated with a Bachelor of Computer Science from the University of Manitoba.  I am passionate about programming, especially in AI and databases. So when I was at the University of Manitoba, I joined the Automuos Agent Lab. In there, I learned how to program the humanoid robot. And our team joined the Hurocup Adult size robot competition. We get 3 places all-round.
